Arcade Game Project
===============================

## How to Play:
You can play the game at [http://kellim.github.io/arcade-game](http://kellim.github.io/arcade-game)

### Gameplay and Objective
Each level, you'll start in the grass at the bottom, and you'll need to cross the road to get to the grass at the top. Once you reach the grass at the top, you'll be awarded 100 points and find yourself back at the bottom ready to start the next level.

You can move using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.

If you collide with a bug, you lose 50 points and go back to your starting place in the grass.

Each level, you will have an opportunity to get a heart and a gem. The heart gives you an extra life and the gem gives you 500 points.

To win the game, you must pass all 20 levels. 

BEWARE: As you level up, the bugs get faster, and you'll also notice more bugs! 

### Tips
Collect hearts for extra lives, especially at lower levels, because you'll likely need them once you get to the higher levels.

Sometimes you can wait for a bit and find an opening where you can take a straight path across the road quickly.

If a heart or gem is on the street near the stony sidwalk at the top, you can try to make it all the way to the sidewalk first, and then walk over so you are above the item and quickly step down to get it while there are no bugs around. But beware, at later levels you will notice the sidwalks being infiltrated by bugs!

### About this Project
This game is my 3rd project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree and it uses Object-Oriented JavaScript.  Here is the link to the project details on Udacity's website: [https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3101888637](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3101888637)

Udacity provided some starter code for the game and I created a working game from it. The bulk of my code is in app.js and Udacity provided resources.js and engine.js. I did make a few changes to engine.js. I also updated index.html and style.css. 

Once I got the minimal game working, I added some additional featues. I edited some of the graphics to make a few different looking bugs to join the lady bugs. I also expanded the game board a bit and changed it up. 

I also wanted to make it more like a game since the minimal version Udacity requires you to create just has the player continuously crossing the street, with no scoring and it stays the same difficulty the whole time. So I added scoring and levels. I made the enemies get a little faster at each new level, and added new enemies at every other level. 

Extra lives are one of my favorite parts about playing video games because I usually need them, so I added the opportunity to get a heart at each level to gain an extra life. I also added gems at each level that provide points. 

I added jQuery and Bootstrap to the project because I wanted more practice with them, and also because I wanted to create a modal with game instructions that pops up when you click a button. Using Bootstrap also made it easy to make the buttons look good.

===============================


How to Play:
You can play the game at http://kellim.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/
You can move using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
Starting in the grass, you need to cross the road while avoiding bugs and get to the grass at the other side, which will gain you 100 points.
If you collide with a bug, you lose 50 points and go back to your starting place in the grass.
Each level, you will have an opportunity to get a heart and a gem. The heart gives you an extra life and the gem gives you 500 points.
To win the game, pass all 20 levels. Be careful-as levels increase, so will the enemies and their speed!
